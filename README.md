# Circuit Inventory Mangement

The test login is username: admin;password: password

<ins>Description</ins>

Circuit board production for small businesses is a nightmare. Lead times on parts can be
up to 6 months. This means that if any of the hundred chips, diodes, resistors, or capacitors that
go into a final product are accidentally not ordered in time, production can be halted for months.
Currently large businesses use their own specific software for inventory management not
available to the public, and software that is available is not specialized enough.
Many small businesses are running into the problem that they can’t access the database
containing their inventory while working from home. A containerized system would help with this.
It is also important that anyone be able to run a ‘build’ and remove parts from inventory. (An
example of this would be to build an order of 100 boards by automatically removing the total
number of each part that would be required from the inventory.)

<ins>Usage</ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run the jar file type:
java -cp target/TD-Circuit-Boards-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar RestfulServer

When running to access the RESTful Webserver type into Postman localhost:8080

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
